Hi [FirstName]!

I just watched your [specific post/video about X] and loved [specific thing you liked]. Your [audience type] audience is exactly who we're trying to reach!

Here's what we offer:
• 75 kawaii template packs (900+ characters)

• Perfect for parents, teachers, crafters

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to explore a partnership?

Hi [FirstName],

Just wanted to follow up on my last email — I know you're busy!

I put together a quick press kit with sample scripts, high-res product photos, and demo videos to make it super easy if you decide to share Blind Box Creator with your audience:

Here's what [OtherInfluencer] said after trying it:
*"My kids haven't touched their iPads in 3 days. They're obsessed with making blind boxes!" — @[influencer], 45K followers*

No pressure at all — but if it's a fit, I'd love to send you VIP access. Just reply "YES" and I'll get you set up today.

Best,
[YourName]

### EMAIL 3: Referral Ask (Day 8)

**Subject Line:**
- "Not a fit? Quick favor?"

**Body:**

```
Hi [FirstName],

Totally understand if Blind Box Creator isn't the right fit for your audience right now!

Quick question: is there anyone in your network (fellow creators, mom bloggers, craft influencers) who might be a better match?

I'd be happy to offer them the same deal (free Pro account + 50% commission) and credit you for the intro.

Either way, thanks for considering! Love your content and excited to see where you go next.

Cheers,
[YourName]

P.S. If you change your mind, the offer stands anytime! Just reply.
