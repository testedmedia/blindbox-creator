  Hey Product Hunt! 👋

  I'm Victor, and I built Blind Box Creator after watching my kids obsess over $15 plastic blind boxes at the store. They'd beg for them every week, get duplicates, and we'd end up with a pile of wasteful packaging.

  So I thought: what if kids could MAKE their own blind boxes instead of buying them?

  **What I built:**
  • AI character generator (text or photo → kawaii character)
  • 75 template packs (900+ printable characters)
  • Rarity system (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
  • Party kits & classroom bundles

  **How it works:**
  1. Type a prompt ("ninja cat with sword") or upload a photo
  2. AI generates a kawaii character instantly
  3. Download PDF template
  4. Print, cut, fold into a blind box
  5. Kids open and discover which rarity they got!

  We've helped 2,500+ families ditch plastic toys and build screen-free memories together. Teachers use it for classroom rewards. Parents use it for birthday parties (way cheaper than store-bought favors!).

  **Special for PH:** First 100 hunters get 50% off Founding Pro (code: PH50)

  I'd love your feedback! What features would you add? What use cases am I missing?

  Let's make crafting cool again! 🌸✨

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Submitting Friday-Sunday** → Low traffic days, won't rank well
❌ **Not rallying upvoters** → Need momentum in first hour
❌ **Ignoring comments** → Engagement = algorithm boost
❌ **Overselling** → Be humble, ask for feedback, not sales
❌ **No special offer** → PH users expect launch discount
❌ **Bad video** → 60%+ watch video, must be polished
❌ **Generic tagline** → "The best blind box creator" = boring

✅ **Do:** Launch Tue-Thu, rally 50+ upvoters, respond to every comment, offer PH-exclusive deal, professional video, specific tagline

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Pick launch date (next Tuesday)
2. ✅ Create `/ph` landing page (with PH50 promo code)
3. ✅ Build upvoter list (50 people)
4. ✅ Design assets (thumbnail, screenshots, video)
5. ✅ Write maker story
6. ✅ Send rally email (2 days before)
7. ✅ Submit at 11:55pm PT (night before)
8. ✅ Monitor + engage all day
