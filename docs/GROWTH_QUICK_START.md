## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Sending generic emails** → Personalize first line (reference recent post)
❌ **No follow-up** → 80% of conversions happen after 2+ emails
❌ **Targeting wrong tier** → Start with nano (1K-10K), not mega influencers
❌ **Asking for too much** → Start small (1 post), build relationship, then ask for more
❌ **Not tracking in CRM** → Update Notion after EVERY action (or you'll forget who you contacted)
❌ **Giving up too soon** → Outreach is a numbers game. 20% reply rate means 80% ignore you. That's normal!

---

## WHEN TO SCALE

**Scale up when:**
- Reply rate consistently >20%
- Partnership rate consistently >50% of replies
- You have bandwidth to manage more partners
- You've automated email sequences (Lemlist/Instantly.ai)

**Scale down when:**
- Reply rate <10% (fix your emails first)
- You're not following up with replies fast enough
- Partners are posting but you're not tracking results

**The goal isn't to contact 1,000 influencers. It's to find 10-20 high-quality partners who post regularly and drive sales.**

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Block 2 hours on your calendar TODAY
2. ✅ Complete "TODAY" checklist above
3. ✅ Set daily reminder: "Check influencer replies at 10am and 4pm"
4. ✅ Set Monday reminder: "Update Notion CRM + plan next week"
5. ✅ Commit to 7 days (even if first batch gets 0 replies — iterate and improve!)

**Start now. First 10 emails sent = momentum unlocked. Let's go! 🚀**
