Hi [FirstName],

I wanted to share how Mrs. Sarah Johnson (3rd grade teacher in Austin) uses Blind Box Creator in her classroom:

📚 **Monday:** Students earn "box tickets" for good behavior all week
🎨 **Friday:** Class craft time — everyone builds their earned boxes together
🎁 **Surprise:** Kids trade characters, create stories, display on classroom shelf

Her class engagement is through the roof. Parents are happy. Kids are learning fine motor skills + creativity.

### Page 3: Parent Letter Template

**[School Letterhead]**

**Dear Parents,**

This week, our class tried a new activity called **Blind Box Creator** — a printable paper craft system where students design and build their own mystery boxes. The kids absolutely loved it!

**What is Blind Box Creator?**
It's a collection of kawaii (Japanese for "cute") blind box templates that kids can print, cut, fold, and assemble at home. Each pack includes 12 characters with different rarity levels (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary), just like collectible trading cards.

**Why we love it:**
✅ **Screen-free fun** — Kids spend 30+ minutes crafting (no iPads!)
✅ **Educational** — Practices fine motor skills, following directions, creativity
✅ **Affordable** — $4.99 per pack (12 characters) vs. $10-$15 for plastic blind boxes
✅ **Eco-friendly** — No plastic packaging, just recyclable paper

**Special discount for our class:**
The founder offered our families **30% off** with code: **[TEACHER30]**

**Try it at home:**
