## BLOCKERS (Address Immediately)

1. **No demo video?** Use screen recording (Loom) + voiceover
2. **Don't know what to say to influencers?** Use templates from GROWTH_STRATEGY.md
3. **No budget for tools?** Start with free tiers: Lemlist trial, Canva free, Klaviyo free
4. **Overwhelmed?** Focus on JUST Task 1-3 this week. Skip the rest for now.

## MINDSET SHIFT

**You're not selling.** You're helping families build memories together.

**You're not asking for favors.** You're offering influencers a way to provide value to their audience (50% commission!).

**You're not spamming.** You're building relationships with people who genuinely care about crafts, kids, and creativity.

**Influencers WANT good products to share.** You just need to make it easy for them.
