## FILMING TIPS

### Equipment
- **Phone camera** (no fancy gear needed)
- **Natural lighting** (film near window, 10am-2pm)
- **Tripod** ($15 Amazon tripod or stack of books)

### Shooting
- **Vertical format** (9:16, TikTok native)
- **Text overlays** (use TikTok's built-in text tool)
- **Fast cuts** (3-5sec per clip max, keep it snappy)
- **Trending sounds** (check TikTok Discover page daily)

### Editing
- **CapCut** (free, easy, built-in effects)
- **Add captions** (80% watch without sound)
- **Transitions** (snap, swipe, zoom)
- **Effects** (sparkle overlay for "magic" moments)

---

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### Every Video Must Have:
1. **Hook in 0-2 seconds** (text overlay or verbal hook)
2. **Value delivery** (teach, entertain, or inspire)
3. **CTA** (comment, duet, link in bio)
4. **Hashtags** (5-8, mix of trending + niche)

### Response Strategy:
- **Reply to ALL comments in first hour** (boosts algorithm)
- **Pin best comment** (creates social proof)
- **Ask questions** ("Which pack should I try next?")
- **Duet/Stitch** top-performing videos (extend reach)

---

## CONTENT BUCKETS (Alternate These)

1. **Tutorial** (How to make...)
2. **Results** (Kids' reactions, testimonials)
3. **Entertainment** (Challenges, trends, comedy)
4. **Behind-the-scenes** (Process, mistakes, fails)
5. **Social proof** (Collections, reviews, UGC)

**Rule:** Never post same bucket 2x in a row. Variety = broader appeal.

---

## VIRAL CHECKLIST

Before posting, ask:
- [ ] Does it hook in 2 seconds?
- [ ] Is it relatable? (Can viewers see themselves doing this?)
- [ ] Is it shareable? (Would someone send this to a friend?)
- [ ] Is it actionable? (Can viewers try this themselves?)
- [ ] Does it use trending audio?
- [ ] Is it under 20 seconds? (optimal length)
- [ ] Does it have a clear CTA?

If 5+ are "YES", post it. If <5, revise.

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Film all 12 videos in one 4-hour session (batch filming)
2. ✅ Schedule posts (Monday/Wednesday/Friday 6pm for 4 weeks)
3. ✅ Set up TikTok analytics tracking (check daily at 9am)
4. ✅ Engage with comments within 1 hour of posting
5. ✅ Analyze top performer after Week 1 → make 3 more like it
